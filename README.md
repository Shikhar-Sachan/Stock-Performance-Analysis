# Stock-Performance-Analysis
In this project, I have simulated the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup-investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. The project includes extracting financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and Web-Scraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data I have visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. Stocks used-> Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.
